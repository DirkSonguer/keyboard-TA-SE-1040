# Triumph Adler SE 1040 Rebuild
The Triumph Adler SE 1040 was a typewriter setup from the mid to late 1980s, consisting of an external keyboard & control unit and a daisy wheel printer unit.

While the printer unit is hard to come by in good shape these days, the keyboards turn up on Ebay from time to time and I managed to grab two for cheap. My initial idea was to re-use the keycaps, which are nice and thick, black, low profile double-shot ABS with MX compatible mount. But when the boards arrived I thought I might try and rebuild them in some way, either by trying some form of conversion (re-using some of the components), or completely replacing the interior with modern tech.

This repo documents my findings in case others want to mod their TA SE 1040s.
